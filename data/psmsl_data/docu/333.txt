=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 03-Dec-1999
According to Dr.Baki Iz (Hong Kong Polytechnic University)
reference benchmarks at the North Point and Quarry Bay gauges show
from episodic levelling significant settlement with respect
to neighbouring marks (October 1998). However, data provided for these
sites are conventionally referred to the more stable Principal Datum
and Rifleman's Bolt benchmark by means of frequent levelling.
Note that the North Point and Quarry Bay datums are the same and
their RLR time series may be combined to make one continuous record
if wished with reasonable confidence.
