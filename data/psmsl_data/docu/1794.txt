It was discovered that the data values for Workington were 18cm low from its installation in 1992 until it was re-levelled on 24.09.02 16:00 GMT. Unfortunately this information was not passed to the PSMSL at the time. This data period has now been adjusted using the BODC data values. Because of this the value of the annual mean for the RLR year 1993 has changed to 4.656m. Therefore the RLR factor has changed from 2.51m to 2.31m. RLR reference to the benchmark NX 9917 2928 has also changed from 14.1m to 13.9m
