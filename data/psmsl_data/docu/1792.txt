The supplying authority has confirmed that following re-organisation in October 2010 the data quality at station Ko Mattaphon deteriorated data during this period - October 2010-August 2012 has been flagged. The old float gauge was replaced by a radar gauge in September 2012. Data following the gauge replacement is again good quality data.
