From levelling information from Douwe Dillingh RLR was calculated pre and port NAP relevelling in 2005. RLR factors pre 2005 6.900m 2005 onwards 6.930m.

The note above stating that periods of the data are MTL is misleading.  Sections of the original data were MTL.  However, Pub. Sci. 5 states “For these periods a shallow water correction has been added to the mean heights of high and low water in order to give a mean height of sea-level comparable with those otherwise calculated for other periods.”  Thus, a correction to MSL has already been applied.
