The tide gauge at Port Ellen is sinking.
This is because the quayside has been gradually
collapsing since 2005. The TGI are aware of the
problem and intend to re-site the gauge.

The measuring system at Port Ellen has had to be relocated
due to the harbour wall subsiding. The new location is 2m
from the original location and the measuring system is
mounted on steel piling. A mid-tide sensor has also been
added and levelling completed. Values are
Full tide sensor -570mm ACD
Mid-tide sensor +475mm ACD
All other parameters remain the same.

Last data avalable for Islay is January 2011. The tide gauge has been removed from the network due to harbour re-development. Work on a replacement installation has begun and is ongoing.
