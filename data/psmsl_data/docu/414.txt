Several datums have been used over the years at Vishakhapatnam. Historically the 1879-1884 benchmark used was BM 29 5.777m above the then datum. The benchmark was later changed to the now Primary benchmark BM 71 PP between 1937-1952 the datum was 6.831m below this point in 1953-1955 6.844m. From 1956 onwards the datum was defined as 'Chart Datum' 6.837m below BM 71 PP this reference remains.

We have changed the first line above, indicating that the MTL ends in 1957, not 1956 as was previously stated.  We have verified that the values in the database are those from Pub. Sci. 20, in which they were indicated as MTL.

A value of MTL-MSL=3 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1937-1957.  This value was derived from the average of three differences in the annual values of MSL and MTL listed in Pub. Sci. 20 and 24.  Note that no correction has been applied to the metric data.
