Motril is part of the newly established REDMAR network.Gauge is a MIROS radar sensor. Benchmark MOT2 is 2.528m relative to TGZ. Constant datum difference of 0.194m from 2007 onwards so RLR factor changes from 6.684m to 6.490m to account for this. See paper B. Perez et al 'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish network'.
