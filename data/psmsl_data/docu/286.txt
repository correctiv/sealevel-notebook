Historic tide gauge information: New datalogger fitted November 2000. A mid-tide sensor was installed in June 2004 with this the levelling was checked and found to be in error. Data for the period 2000-2004 was adjusted by 38mm to correct for this and the statistics re-calculated. Immingham tide gauge is situated within the Humber Estuary and so is influenced by density variations caused by the effect of fresh water flow.
