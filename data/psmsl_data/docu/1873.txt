The gauge type is a MORS (bottom-mounted pressure gauge). The tide gauge is installed in the Baie du Navire,Possession Island, in the Crozet archipielago,nearby the Alfred Faure french scientific base. The gauge is a MORS automatic tide gauge station and consists of a ventilated ParoScientific pressure sensor at the base of a stilling well which is used to filter waves.  The ventilation of the sensor results in a measurement of the total pressure (atmosphere + ocean) minus the atmosphere; hence, a direct measure of sea level,assuming water density is properly estimated.
