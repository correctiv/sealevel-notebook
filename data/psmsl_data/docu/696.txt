SMRC Newsletter Jul-Dec 2001 reports high E coast correlation with SOI and MSL. MSL is much higher during La Nina tropical cyclones than during El Nino.

Mangalore tide gauge was located in a river estuary, unlike Mangalore Panamburu (500/070) which is on the open coast. The seasonal cycles of MSL are very different at the two locations.

Mangalore is now an historic station. Last data is 1976.

We have changed the first line above, indicating that the MTL ends in 1957, not 1956 as was previously stated.  We have verified that the values in the database are those from Pub. Sci. 20, in which they were indicated as MTL.  In addition, the starting year of 1953 was changed to 1952, in that the three values from 1952 are also MTL.

A value of MTL-MSL=0 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1952-1957.  This value was derived using a historic databank of harmonic tidal constants gathered by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).  Care must be taken when using these IHO constants, though, as there are many known errors in tidal amplitudes and phases.
