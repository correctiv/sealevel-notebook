During May 2013 the primary channel started blocking and because of this was recording over 20mm high. On 11.08.2013 TGI were at site to purge the system and carry out general maintenance. While there they also changed the compressor and further investigated the blocking channel.

At the beginning of 2014 there were again problems with channel blocking. TGI were at site 15.01.14 to clear the pneumatic line blockage and again on 03.04.14 for general maintenence and to dive to inspect and again clear the blocking channel.
