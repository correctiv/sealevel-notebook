The data used to be measured to Normal Null which is a German datum related to levels at Potsdam near Berlin. It is similar to ODN in the UK or NAP in Holland. It is ususual therefore that the station was made RLR as it 'breaks the rules' of RLR. Data 2000 onwards refers to TGZ.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 26-Jan-2016
A value of MTL-MSL=-81 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1963-1984.  This value was derived by Thomas Wahl, using the "k factor method" described in Wahl et al., 61, 701-715, 2011.

Using values from the BSH website the latitude and longitude for this stations have been updated.
