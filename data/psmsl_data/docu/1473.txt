Using the latest JASL data the complete dataset has been reloaded. Referring to the UH levelling information it is clear that the RLR diagram was prepared using the 1978 levelling value of 2.563m for benchmark UH-1.This remained stable within +2mm before being destroyed. The remaining stable benchmark in the 1996 and 2000 levelling is BM @ which relates to the tide staff. This has been added to the RLR diagram.
