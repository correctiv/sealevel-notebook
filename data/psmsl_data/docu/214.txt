=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 21-Jul-1994
A stilling well gauge, probably a Kelvin-Hughes type, was installed in July 1917 at the "tide gauge pier", replaced in November 1939 by another, probably also a Kelvin-Hughes, at the "Ordnance Pier,Landguard", and replaced in September 1948 by another, probably again a Kelvin-Hughes, at the "tide gauge pier". In 1953 the gauge was damaged in the great floods and in 1954 it was repaired with a Cary-Porter/Kelvin Hughes system. In July 1980 an Aanderaa pressure system gauge was installed, replaced by an "A Class" bubbler in September 1988.

Historic tide gauge information: In Aug.1996 new pressure points and steelworks were fitted together with a mid-tide sensor. No access to the pressure points has been possible since 1999
as the pier is condemned.
