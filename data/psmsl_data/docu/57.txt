Levelling information recently supplied by the Finnish Meteorological Institute
confirms that previous benchmark 1139G is no longer used. From 2000 onwards
Primary benchmark is 00003 3.294 above gauge datum. While this was being
reviewed it was noticed that data for the period Jan1919-Dec1921 was not
included as RLR leaving a gap in the RLR dataset. Although this was
investigated no reason was found for this anomaly. This data period has now
been included in the RLR dataset.

Following the 2016 levelling exercise some adjustments have been made to the benchmark reference heights - at Vaasa this was +1mm for BM 00003. The adjustments are a result of more accurate measuring and calculations using the N2000 height system. The RLR diagram has been re-drawn because of this.
