Using information from the UH levelling sheet the RLR diagram has been revised. Value of the Primary benchmark
BM 1 was taken from levelling in 1977 and 1984. The value for BM 1 in subsequent levelling exercises wander slightly. A new primary benchmark BM 6 was installed in March 2000 with a value of 2.1006m. This has remained stable through to the last levelling carried out in 2013. Primary benchmark BM 6 has been added to the RLR diagram.
