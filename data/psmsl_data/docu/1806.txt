A paper by Marcos et al (JGR Volume 11, 2005) provides an overview of the tide gauge records on the northern coast of Spain.

Previous dataset was July 1992-December 2001 complete with no gaps. No data for 2002 then January 2003-December 2007 again with no gaps. Begona from PE recently supplied a dataset for Bilbao 2003-2009. These values were quite different to what was on the database. When this was queried with Begona she confirmed these values were from a completely different gauge. She then supplied dataset July 1992-December 2008 these data values were checked. Values identical with those on the database with the addition of data for January-July 2002 and 2008. These have been added to the database.

The SRD acoustic gauge at Bilbao has been moved and replaced by a new MIROS radar gauge. Both old and new were running for the period 3.6.2009-12.01.2010 for inter-comparison purposes.A bias (mean difference) of 4.7cm was calculated between the two gauges.Hardware problems (de-lamination) was experienced with the new tide gauge together with a datum change of 1.8cm. These have been taken into account and applied to the data supplied. See paper B. Perez et al 'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish network'.

On further investigation it became apparent to Puertos del Estado that the bias detected between old and new datasets was an indication of problems in the old Acoustic tide gauge. The dataset from the old gauge has been revised to account for this. Whole dataset has been re-entered onto the database.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 28-Apr-2014
At the request of Puertos del Estado the latitude and longitude for this station have been revised from 43.333333 -3.033333 - which related to the old gauge to 43.35153 -3.04513 which is the location of the new MIROS gauge.
