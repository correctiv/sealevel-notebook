Since the change in the method of sea level recording from
measuring downwards to the usual measuring upwards the tidal
plot for Thessalonika had appeared in error as there seemed
to be a large upwards jump. Following lengthy correspondence
with the HNHS it transpires that following a datum control
and levelling exercise a correction of +0.34m was applied
to the TGZ. When this correction was applied the data
plot appears to be OK.See Greek letter in reply to the letter of 26th March 2007.

The Hellenic Navy have recently supplied datum diagrams for each of there stations. Previously used benchmark R 16 does not appear on the new diagram. In consequence the RLR diagram has been re-drawn using benchmark R. As a result the RLR factors have changed.
