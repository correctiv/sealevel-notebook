=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 28-Jun-2010
Iskenderun II is on the Eastern Mediterranean Coast. This station forms part of
the Turkish Sea Level Monitoring Network. Coast/Station code 310/066 id=2020.
This station has been re-instated but it is not possible to combine the two
datasets.
Therefore a new series was created and an RLR diagram created.
RLR (2009) is 7.600m below TGBM ISKD-1. RLR factor is 4.770m.
