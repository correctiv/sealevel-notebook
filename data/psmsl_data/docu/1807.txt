The SRD acoustic gauge at Santander has been replaced by a new MIROS radar sensor. Both old and new gauges were running in parallel for the period 6.02.2008-17.03.2009 for inter-comparison purposes. A bias (mean difference) of -0.76cm was calculated between the two gauges. See paper by B. Perez et al 'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish network'

With further investigation it became apparent to Puertos del Estado that the bias detected between old and new datasets was an indication of problems with the old Acoustic gauge. Data from the old gauge has been revised to account for this. Whole dataset has been re-entered onto the database.

At the request of Puertos del Estado the latitude and longitde have been changed from 43.366667 -3.783333 which related to the old SRD gauge to 43.46130 -3.79076 which is the new MIROS gauge.
