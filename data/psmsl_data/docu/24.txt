ALL DUTCH METRIC DATA ARE MEASURED TO NAP (NORMAAL AMSTERDAMSCH PEIL)
PRIOR TO 1936 VALUES BASED ON HIGH AND LOW WATERS OR ON 4 OR 8 READINGS/DAY

Levelling information was received from Douwe Dillingh RLR was calculated for both before and after NAP re-levelling in 2005. RLR factors up to 2005 6.815m after 6.823m.

The note above stating that periods of the data are MTL is misleading.  Sections of the original data were MTL.  However, Pub. Sci. 5 states “For these periods a shallow water correction has been added to the mean heights of high and low water in order to give a mean height of sea-level comparable with those otherwise calculated for other periods.”  Thus, a correction to MSL has already been applied.
