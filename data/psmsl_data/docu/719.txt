Morehead City is an Historic station. The last data received was for 1962. There is an entry for Morehead City Harbour, Harbour Channel North Carolina on the NOAA website. This also has B M 1 as one of the benchmarks. However when the datum relationship is calculated it is very different to that on the original RLR diagram.
