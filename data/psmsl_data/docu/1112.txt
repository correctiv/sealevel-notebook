A value of MTL-MSL=-73 mm has been derived using the GESLA2 (high-frequency tide gauge) dataset using harmonic constituents. As the correction is only applied to RLR data and the data from 1965 is metric, it is not used in the data set.  Should this period become metric in future, however, it would be used. The 001 flag has been set only because this correction is highly uncertain.
