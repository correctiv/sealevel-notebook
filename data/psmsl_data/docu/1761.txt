Station density along some sections of the Australian coast has meant that station codes 601 onwards have been re-ordered compared to those in earlier versions of the PSMSL data set.

This is a "baseline station" of the Australian National Tidal Facility.

Hillarys            680/472 RLR(2000) is 10.511m below HZ879

The Hillarys record suggests that sea level is rising relatively fast due to local submergence from compaction of the coastal sandy location and significant ground water extraction, see the chapter by Deng et al. entitled 'Satellite Altimetry for Geodetic, Oceanographic and Climate Sudies in the Australian Region' in the book Coastal Altimetry (Wiley, 2011)

Using information from the National Tidal Centre, Australia the RLR diagram has been revised. Benchmark HZ879 is 4.211m above TGZ. Benchmark Hamersley 130 T1 is 4.895m above TGZ and the national datum reference is 0.763m above tgz. The RLR factor is 6.3m.

The high rate of sea level rise at Hillarys during the two decades since the early 1990s has been linked to groundwater withdrawal, see Burgette et al. (2013 Geophysical Journal International).
