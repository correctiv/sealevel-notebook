The SRD acoustic gauge at Huelva has been replaced by a new MIROS radar gauge.
Both old and new gauges were running for the period 01.01.2008-31.12.2008 for inter-comparison
purposes. A bias (mean difference) of 0.23cm was calculated.
Hardware problems (de-lamination) were encountered with the new gauge this has now been taken
into account in the data supplied.  See paper by B. Perez et al.
'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different technologies: an example from
the REDMAR Spanish network'.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Jan-2014
Further investigation by Puertos del Estado revealed that the bias at iold and new datasets was due to a problem with the old Acoustic gauge. Data from this was revised. Complete dataset was re-entered onto the database.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 28-Apr-2014
At the request from Puertos del Estado the latitude and longitude have been changed from 31.133333 -6.833333 derived from the previously supplied degrees and minutes value to 37.13202 -6.83369 which is the site of the new MIROS gauge in decimal degrees.
