These  data represent inferred sea level from a sub-
surface pressure gauge, which measures the
combined weight of the column of water and air
above it.  A constant atmospheric pressure has been
subtracted, but variations in atmospheric pressure,
which would not be sensed by a conventional float/
well gauge, would affect the measurement of the
sub-surface pressure gauge.
The depth of the instrument in the water is
 unconfirmed.
