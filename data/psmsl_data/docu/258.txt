PRIOR TO 1978 DATA SUPPLIED BY AUTHORITY CODE NO. 95
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 04-Nov-1998
data for 1990-91 replaced with revised values received from authority 41
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 30-Oct-2006
Following the supply of data 1978-2005 banked data revised and updated RLR value also calculated. FCODE in STTN table revised from HL to 24. However data 1924-1977 are Mean Tide Level(MTL) values.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 03-Oct-2011
It has come to our notice that there was an error in the RLR diagram for Ponta Delgada. The diagram has been re-calculated, as a result the RLR factor changed from 5.887m to 5.871m. The data has been adjusted.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 22-Jan-2016
A value of MTL-MSL=3 mm has been derived using the GESLA2 (high-frequency tide gauge) dataset using harmonic constituents. As the correction is only applied to RLR data and the data from 1924-1977 is metric, it is not used in the data set.  Should this period become RLR in future it would be used.
