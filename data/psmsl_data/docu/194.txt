Levelling information recently supplied by the Finnish Meteorological Institute confirms previous benchmark 1196E is no longer in use. Benchmark 1196G is 5.689m above gauge datum and benchmark 10401 4.015m above gauge datum was added in 2010.

In the 2016 yearly levelling of the Finnish tide gauges by the National Land Survey of Finland it was found that the benchmark 10401 was sinking by approximately 0.5mm per year. As a result this benchmark will not now be used but be replaced by the bed rock benchmark 1196G. These findings caused a correction of -3mm to the data for June 2013 onwards and 2014 data. The data values have been adjusted for this. Primary benchmark is now 1196G. The RLR diagram has been re-drawn.
