Haringvliet 10 is a Enraf Nonius DNM (Digitale Niveau Meter)
float gauge installed on a 'pile' 5 km from shore.
June 28th 2001 the 20m high 'pile' was again replaced.  This
makes the use of benchmarks difficult.  All data supplied to
the PSMSL is to NAP.

Haringvliet - RIKZ note October 1999 onwards data rising, up to
approx. 3 cm by December 2000.  Difficult to verify as no
benchmark available.

From recent information received giving values of NAP both before and after the
re-levelling exercise of 2005 most of the Dutch stations have been converted to
RLR. However, as this station is an offshore tide gauge which hasn't been
re-checked since it's installation it remains 'Metric'.
