=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 01-Jul-2010
During May 2010 the complete revised data holding from the Turkish Sea Level
Monitoring Network were supplied to the PSMSL from the General Command of
Mapping.All datasets including that for Bodrum II were replaced. Previously RLR
the values were TGBM BM MARI 3.475m above Chart Datum. RLR (1986) 8.608m below
TGBM BM MARI. RLR factor 6.0m.
A revised RLR diagram was created with Primary Benchmarl BDRM-1 2.578m above
TGZ.
RLR (2008) 8.3m below TGBM BDRM-1. RLR factor 5.722m
Add 5.722m to all data values to refer to RLR (2008).
There also exists a secondary benchmark BDRM-2. This is 2.407m above TGZ.
