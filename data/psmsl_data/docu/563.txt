Although an RLR factor existed Gibara was never actually an RLR station. Gibara has now been created an RLR station with RLR factor 5.032m.Both the benchmark and the TGZ are related to the Geodesic National Datum (GND). TGBM DATUM is 1.148m relative to GND while TGZ is -0.92m relative to GND. Data is referred to TGZ. Early data 1949-1972 has been left as 'Metric' as datum of the early data in unknown.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 03-Mar-2016
To reflect the fact that the monthly means supplied refer to TGZ and not GND the RLR diagram has been redrawn. As a result the RLRFAC has changed fron 5.032m to 6.032m. RLR (2008) is now 8.1m below TGBM DATUM.

Information received from Cuba the tide gauge sensors are listed as from 1970 a float recording hourly and from 2013 a datalogger coupled to the float with 6 minute frequency.
