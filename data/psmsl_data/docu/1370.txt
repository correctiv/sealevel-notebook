Complete updated JASL dataset loaded onto the database. UHSLC metadata reports that data 2001-2004 were adjusted by +7mm to link to the zero assigned to the update of 2005-2012 provided in May 2013 by NTC.

Referring to the UH levelling sheet for Pohnpei benchmark USGS1 is confirmed as the Primary Benchmark. However, through successive levellings it is not completely stable. It appears that the RLR diagram was prepared using the 1976/1981 values of 2.479m rounded to 3 decimal places. This agrees with the historic levelling sheet found with the original RLR diagram. Over time the values change from a maximum of 2.4792m in 1976 to a minimum of 2.4725m in 1991. Value for the last levelling exercise in 2004 is 2.4778m.

The update documented on 2015-11-04 was performed incorrectly: the data loaded was from the Australian National Tidal Centre's gauge and should have been loaded to PSMSL ID 1925. Data for 2002-2004 have been replaced with the original data from UHSLC (using their series 001b), data from 2005-2014 have been removed. The gauge was removed in 2004.
