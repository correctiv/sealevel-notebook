This year, rather than just sending the latest year of data, the complete dataset has been supplied. This has highlighted some differences in the data. From communications in the correspondence file for 2002 it appears that the Oceans and Fisheries meant to supply revised data for the stations supplied. This did not happen. The complete dataset includes these data revisions. Therefore, the whole dataset has now been re-entered.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 30-Jul-2015
Historic data was included in the above complete dataset. The datum for the period 1909-1920 is currently being queried. Until the Fisheries and Oceans Canada confirm the datum this data has been made Metric.

The datum for the historic data for 1909-1920 has been confirmed to be the same as the remaining data. This data has now been added to the RLR data series.
