=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 11-Jun-1991
Posidhonia          290/011 RLR(1981) is 8.6m below BM R67
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 11-Mar-1997
The contributing authority advises that anomalous values are the result of met. influences
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 14-Jun-2000
Posidonia tide gauge malfunctioned 1994, repaired in 1999. Data for 1994-6 deleted from database.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 14-May-2001
Data for 1999 onwards looks approx 0.3 m higher than pre-1994 data. HNHS state that the gauge is operating normally and so it is assumed that no datum change has occurred.

Station flagged and switched from RLR to 'Metric' because of datum anomaly.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 03-Mar-2011
After a review of the dataset it was decided that the data for October 1999-December 2002 be revised to RLR. Data for the period January 2003 onwards when the method of data measured was changed has been relegated to 'Metric'. However the station has been reinstated as RLR so that the 'good' RLR data is visible on the website. The station remains flagged.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Jul-2011
Following further information from the Hellenic Navy Oceanography Service a datum adjustment was applied to the data for 2003 onwards. When plotted the data now appears correct. RLR status has been reinstated and the station flag removed.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 07-Aug-2013
Following receipt of datum diagrams from the Hellenic Navy the RLR diagram has been re-drawn. In consequence both the RLR factors and the benchmark reference have changed.
