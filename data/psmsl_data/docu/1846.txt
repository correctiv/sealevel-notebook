Using the UHSLC levelling sheets the RLR diagram has been revised. The original Primary benchmark UH -1 3.064m above the datum was derived from a publication by the Ministry of the Enviroment Seychelles. This correlates reasonably well - within 1-2mm with the value on the UH levelling sheet for levelling carried out between 1999 and 2002. In the 2008 levelling the Primary benchmark was changed to UH -4 3.647m above the datum this was superceded in 2013 by Primary benchmark RS2 1.417m above the datum. Both these Primary benchmarks have been added to the diagram with the primary now being nominated as RS2.
