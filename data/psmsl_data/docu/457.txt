Using data from SONEL the latitude and longitude for St. Nazaire has been updated. The data downloaded from SONEL contained a number of additional and revised data points particularly around the early 2000's. Because of this the whole dataset was reloaded onto the database. This revised dataset had been adjusted to the same datum. With the revision to the dataset data values for 1943 onwards now have the RLR factor 3.505m.
