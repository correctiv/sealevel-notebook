Older data from Brest are taken from the original volumes of the Publications Scientifiques. In those, 1807-35 are said to be Mean Tide Level and 1846 onwards true Mean Sea Level. At Brest MSL is 23mm above MTL (some estimates say 29 mm), see Woppelmann et al. Ocean Dynamics, 56, 487-497, 2006 (and beware that the equation top of page 495 should read MTL-MSL). (NOTE: 23 and 29 mm values switched to better reflect paper. 26-Jan-2016)

After investigation the RLR diagram has been revised. Primary benchmark remains the same but the name has been changed to agree with SONEL. Benchmark name is now NO-47. The RLR factor has also been changed when a 2mm discrepancy was found from the original diagram. RLR factor for 1996 onwards is now 2.959.
