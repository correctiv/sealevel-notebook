Details are obscure until a Lege gauge was installed in August 1955 - 1832-1955 records are held by POL but gauge make is not known.  The Lege was replaced by a Munro in November 1962, moved to a new site in April 1963 and again in May 1973, replaced by an Ott in 1980, an Aanderaa pressure system in July 1983, and an "A Class" bubbler gauge from October 1986.

Values for 1998- appear slightly higher than anticipated from inspection of neighbouring records - cause may be instrumental.

Last data for Sheerness is 2009. This is because the primary channel is recording 1-2m high possibly due to bio-fouling
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 04-Jul-2014
There were no MSL's produced for 2013 for Sheerness. The primary channel is still recording a constant value of around -1.026m. A site visit was made on 08.01.2013 to perform levelling at the site and investigate the blocking of the primary channel. However, the channel could not be cleared and will require divers to clear the blockage. A visit was also carried out on 05.06.2013 for general maintenance.
