Landsort and its replacement Landsort Norra were previously recorded as one
dataset. However this is not the case with the SMHI website. The decision was
taken to mirror the SMHI. The two stations have been levelled in one to the
other and so can still be used as one series. From information supplied by
the SMHI the name of the benchmark has changed from No. Fix 146J (a)
to BM c.
