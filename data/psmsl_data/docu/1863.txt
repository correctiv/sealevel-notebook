Tide gauge is an Aanderaa WLR7 tide recorder.
The gauge is installed in the crater of a
partially submerged volcano, communicating
with the open ocean through a narrow (100m)
and shallow (2m at low tide) pass.  This bottom
pressure sensor is at the base of a stilling well
which is used to filter waves.  The recorder is
triggered by a central unit where the barometric
pressure is measured at the same time.
