Station flagged data generally suspect. Large spike in dataset Nov/Dec 2002 values very suspect.

Heights of chart datum relative to land levelling datum in South Africa and Namibia: Knysna Datum: up to 31st Dec 1978 = -0.625 Datum: 1st Jan 1979 - 31st Dec 1997 = -0.900 Datum: 1st Jan 1998 - 31st Dec 2002 = -1.048 Datum: 1st Jan 2003 onwards = -0.788 Datum is now LAT so unlikely to change.

There appears to be a spike in Nov/Dec 2002 see above. This is possibly real as it appears in several of the S. African stations.
