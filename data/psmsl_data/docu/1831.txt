The datum history at Ascension is complicated. Half-tide ref. 1993-1998 and 2006-2007 was used for the data June 1993-June 1998 and again for data Jan. 2006-Dec 2007. Half-tide datum Apr. 1999-Mar. 2001 was used specifically for that period. Half-tide ref. Ascension B datum Sept. 2005 was used for Nov. and Dec data 2005 and also data for Jan.2008- May 2010. Full tide datum B gauge 870mm below the original datum for 1993-1998 and 2006-2007 was used for data Dec. 2010 onwards.
