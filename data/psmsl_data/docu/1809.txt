The old SRD acoustic gauge for Bonanza has been replaced by a new MIROS radar gauge . Both old and new gauges were run in parallel for the period 13.01.2010-13.11.2010 for inter-comparison purposes. A bias (mean difference) of 5.01cm between the two gauges was found as was a malfunction of the old sensor. See paper B. Perez et al 'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish netwotk'

Further investigation revealed that the bias between old and new datasets was due to a gauge fault int he old Acoustic gauge. Data from this was revised. Complete dataset has been re-entered onto the database.

At the request from Puertos del Estado the latitude and longitude have been changed from 36.800000 -6.333333 derived from the previously supplied degrees and minutes value to 36.80221 -6.33813 as this is the site of the new MIROS gauge in decimal degrees.
