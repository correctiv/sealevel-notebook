Complete updated JASL dataset loaded onto the database. There appeared to be a difference in datum with the two UH plots from 1993-2001 but when this was compared with the NTC dataset they agreed so the updated UH data was loaded. While reviewing the UH levelling sheets it would appear that the RLR diagram has been created using the value for benchmark CT/1 from the 1980/1982 levelling values. This value has not remained stable and has a values of 2.528m from the final 1996 levelling. Comments in the levelling sheets reveal that all relevant reference points to CT/1 were destroyed by fire.
