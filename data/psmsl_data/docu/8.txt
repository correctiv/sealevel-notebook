These values are of Wismar MSL relative to the HN datum as computed by the University of Dresden. See the report "Die Reduktion historischer Wasserstandsmessungen an der Kueste Mecklenburg-Vorpommerns auf das Hoehensystem HN76" by G.Liebsch, R.Dietrich, L.Ballani and G.Langer.

Prior to 1894 readings from tide pole.  1894 analogue gauge installed. 1945-52 tide pole while new gauge installed. Dresden analyses based on:
1848-1882 1 reading per day, corrected for tidal effects
1883-1894(June) 4 readings per day, corrected for tidal effects
1894(July)-1945 4 readings per day from charts
1946-1952 1 to 4 readings per day, corrected for tidal effects
1953-1980 4 readings per day
So, tidal aliasing effects should be largely removed from Desden values

Wismar data up to 1992 supplied by Technische Universitat Dresden (auth=H3).  Data 1993- supplied by Bundesamt fur Seeschiffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH), Hamburg (auth=16).

The data for Wismar was measured to Normal Null which is a German datum related to Potsdam near Berlin. It is similar to ODN in the UK or NAP in Holland. It is unusual therefore to relate the data to RLR as it 'breaks the rules' of RLR. Data now refers to TGZ.
