The SRD acoustic gauge at Malaga has been moved and replaced by a new MIROS radar sensor.
Both new and old gauges were running for the period 22.01.2009-23.04.2010 for
inter-comparison purposes. A bias (mean difference) of 0.18cm was calculated. See paper
by B. Perez et al 'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different
technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish network'.
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 13-Jan-2014
Further investigation revealed that the bias was due to a problem in the old Acoustic gauge. Data from this was revised. Complete dataset was re-entered onto the database.

At the request of Puertos del Estado the latitude and longitude have been revised from 36.716667 -4.416667 derived from the previously supplied degrees and minutes value to 36.71184 -4.41709 the site of the new MIROS gauge in decimal degrees.
