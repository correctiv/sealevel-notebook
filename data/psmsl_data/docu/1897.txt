The SRD acoustic gauge at Villagarcia has been moved and replaced by a new MIROS radar sensor. Both old and new gauges were running for the period 24.04.2008-24.06 2009 for inter-comparison purposes. A bias (mean difference) of 1.52cm was found between the two gauges.Hardware problems (de-lamination) were initially experienced with the new MIROS gauge. There was also a change in datum of 7.2cm from Oct.2012. These have been taken in account with the supplied data. See paper B.Perez et al 'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish network'.

Futher investigation from Puertos del Estado revealed that the bias seen between old and new datasets was due to a problem with the old Acoustic gauge. Old dataset was revised to account for this. Whole dataset was re-entered onto the database.

At the request from Puertos del Estado the latitude and longitude have been changed from 42.600000 -8.766667 which was derived from the previously supplied degrees and minutes value to 42.60071 -8.77003 which is the position of the new MIROS gauge in decimal degrees.
