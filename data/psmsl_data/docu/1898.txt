The SRD acoustic gauge at Vigo has been moved and replaced by a new MIROS radar gauge. Both old and new gauges were running for the period 20.11.2008-31.12.2009 for inter-comparison purposes. A bias (mean difference) of -0.71cm was calculated. Hardware problems (de-lamination) were also initially experienced at the new MIROS gauge this has been taken into account in the supplied data. See paper by B. Perez et al 'Overlapping sea level time series measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish network'.

Further investigation by Puertos del Estado revealed the bias between old and new datasets was due to a problem with the old Acoustic gauge. Data from this was revised. Whole dataset has been re-entered onto the database.

At the request of Puertos del Estado the latitude and longitude have been changed from 42.250000 -8.733333 which was derived from the previously supplied degrees and minutes value to 42.24314 -8.72600 which is the position of the new MIROS gauge in decimal degrees.
