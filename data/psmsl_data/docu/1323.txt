=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 27-Jul-2015
This year, rather than just sending the latest year of data, the complete dataset has been supplied. This has highlighted some differences in the data. From communications in the correspondence file for 2002 it appears that the Oceans and Fisheries meant to supply revised data for the stations supplied. This did not happen. The complete dataset includes these data revisions. Therefore, the whole dataset has now been re-entered.
Just one isolated datapoint for August 1958 has been switched to Metric.
