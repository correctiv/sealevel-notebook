Punta della Salute  270/054 RLR(1919,Stefano) is 6.893 m below 'IGM1897'
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 24-Nov-1999
RLR values for Venice San Stefano (270/051) and Punta della Salute (270/054) should be to essentially the same datum enabling one composite record to be made.

Data for 1909-1939 are Mean Tide Level which at Venice should be within 4 mm of Mean Sea Level. Data were obtained via Paolo Pirazzoli March 2000.

The secular trend in MSL at venice during the twentieth century was a factor or two greater than at Trieste, which is almost certainly related to local anthropogenic effects including ground water pumping, see for example several publications by P.A.Pirazzoli.

A value of MTL-MSL=0 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1909-1939.  This is in agreement with the 2000Mar24 comment. Values of -1 mm and 4 mm were derived from two records in the GESLA2 (high-frequency tide gauge) dataset.
Venezia (Punta Della Salute) is an historic station last data 2000
