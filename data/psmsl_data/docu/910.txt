For discussions of MSL changes and extreme sea levels around Namibia and South Africa, see: G.B.Brundrit, S.Afr.J.Mar.Sci.,16,9-17,1995 and S.Searson and G.B.Brundrit, S.Afr.J.of Science, 91,579-588,1995. 1958 - 1972 Values based on 8 readings per day for 1978 very suspect and deleted.

1990 data looks highly suspect treat with caution.

Heights of chart datum relative to land levelling datum in South Africa and Namibia: Mossel Bay Datum: up to 31st Dec 1978 = -0.761, Datum: 1st Jan 1979 - 31st Dec 1997 = -0.900, Datum: 1st Jan 1998 - 31st Dec 2002 = -1.163, Datum: 1st Jan 2003 onwards = -0.933, Datum is now LAT so unlikely to change.

SANHO is in the process of re-evaluating and standardising all the tidal station benchmarks. Confirming their accuracy in relation to the existing national benchmark network. This process was carried out at Mossel Bay during Feb. 2007 with new benchmarks installed in May 2007. The new benchmarks are TG Hut LLD +2.7002m New HO2 LLD +3.9022m VT-3 LLD +2.6366m
=========================== FOLLOWING PSMSL DOCUMENTATION ADDED 15-May-2012
Data for Mossel Bay looks high following the installation of the new benchmarks particularly when viewed as the annual rather than the monthly means.

The apparent spike for August 2015 has been queried with the South African Navy. They are unaware of any specific problems but commented that the region experienced terrible weather during this period. Also, the tide gauge at Mossel is more exposed to open water influences than the other SA gauges which are more protected by the harbours.
