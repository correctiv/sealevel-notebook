Following investigation on the Norwegian Mapping Authority website it was
obvious that the complete dataset had been revised. As no common bench mark 
could be found RLR was re-calculated using 2008 data therefore re-instating
 the station as RLR. Revised RLR factor is 7.266m. RLR (2008) is 11.0m below 
TGBM G35 N34.
