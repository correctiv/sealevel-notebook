Using data from Fisheries and Oceans Canada the RLR diagram has been updated. The Primary benchark remains 4 6.888m above TGZ last inspected 2006. The previously displayed benchmark T.S. 12.849m above TGZ is no longer 'active' and has been omitted from the diagram.

This year, rather than just sending the latest year of data, the complete dataset has been supplied. This has highlighted some differences in the data. From communications in the correspondence file for 2002 it appears that the Oceans and Fisheries meant to supply revised data for the stations supplied. This did not happen. The complete dataset includes these data revisions. Therefore, the whole dataset has now been re-entered.
