Last data received for this station was 1996. However as the Lat., Long., and benchmark details remain as before the data was simply added to the existing dataset. Primary benchmark since 1966 is BM 130 7.37m above chart datum. Previous benchmark 1950-1964 was BM 133 8.227m above chart datum.

There appears to be a shift in datum from 1954 onwards.

A value of MTL-MSL=-157 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1950-1951.  This value was derived from the average of three differences in the annual MSL and MTL listed for the station in Pub. Sci. 24.  Note that no correction has been applied to the metric data.
