The original datum and benchmark was BM 97 6.060m above the datum for 1881-1885. In 1948 the benchmark was changed to BM 4/2 4.869m above chart datum. In 1965 the benchmark was again changed to BM 2014 8.37m relative to chart datum. This remains the primary benchmark.

We have changed the first line above, indicating that the MTL ends in 1958, not 1956 as was previously stated.  We have verified that the values in the database are those from Pub. Sci. 20, in which they were indicated as MTL.

A value of MTL-MSL=-49 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1948-1958.  This value was derived from the average of three differences in the annual MSL and MTL listed for the station in Pub. Sci. 24.  Note that no correction has been applied to the metric data.
