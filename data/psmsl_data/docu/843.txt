A revised dataset for Santa Cruz das Flores (1976-2009) was received from the Hydrographic Institute Portugal. Where the data already existed when compared the values were almost identical but it was decided to update the database with the revised values. Previously the station had been known as 'Flores' . As the Hydrographic Institute now refer to it as Santa Cruz das Flores the name was edited to agree with this.

A value of MTL-MSL=3 mm has been using the GESLA2 (high-frequency tide gauge) dataset using harmonic constituents. As the correction is only applied to RLR data and the data from 1957-169 is metric, it is not used in the data set.  Should this period become metric in future, however, it would be used.
