A value of MTL-MSL=19 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1955-1956. The value was derived using a historic databank of harmonic tidal constants gathered by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).  Care must be taken when using these IHO constants, though, as there are many known errors in tidal amplitudes and phases.
