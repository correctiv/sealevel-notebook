A. Jessen (Geodetic Institute, Copenhagen, Report No. 46, 1970) reports approx. 5cm level subsidence around 1942, based on primary levelling. Probable reason escape of underground gas during prospecting.  Similar results are presented in an internal report of Palle B. Nielsen (Farvandsvaesenet, Copenhagen, 1933) - after correction for ad-hoc subsidence factors, time series is simsilar to that at Hirtshals.
