The Aanderra pressure gauge at Hierro has been moved and replaced by a new MIROS
radar sensor. Both old and new gauges were operating for the period 14.11.2009-
15.06.2010 for inter-comparison purposes. During this period a bias (mean difference) between the two
gauges was calculated as -0.29cm. A malfunction in the old sensor was also detected.
There was also a datum change of -9cm from Nov. 2011.
See B. Perez et al paper 'Overlapping sea level time series
measured using different technologies: an example from the REDMAR Spanish
network'.

Further investigation revealed that the bias was due to a fault in the old Pressure gauge. Data from this was revised. Complete dataset was re-entered into database.

At the request of Puerto del Estado the latitude and longitude have been changed from 27.800000 -17.898333 derived from the previously supplied degrees and minutes value to 27.78408 -17.90163 which is the position of the new MIROS gauge in decimal degrees.
