We have changed the first line above, indicating that the MTL ends in 1957, not 1956 as was previously stated.  We have verified that the values in the database are those from Pub. Sci. 20, in which they were indicated as MTL.

A value of MTL-MSL=31 mm has been applied to the RLR data for the period 1937-1957.  This value was derived from the average of three differences in the annual MSL and MTL listed for the station in Pub. Sci. 24.  Note that no correction has been applied to the metric data.
