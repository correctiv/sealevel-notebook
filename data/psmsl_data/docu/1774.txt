There were several visits to site during 2013. 16.01.2013 TGi carried out installation in the refurbished building. 06.03.2013 two new benchmarks were established at either end of Gladstone Dock. 12.11.2013 site survey was carried out and a meeting held with the surveyors. It is known that the pier is subsiding.During April and May 2013 both full tide channels were recording ~40mm high. The two new benchmarks should monitor any movement.By the end of July channel 2 was fluctuating between 20mm low and 30mm high. From September channel 2 was showing ~60mm low on several falling tides.
