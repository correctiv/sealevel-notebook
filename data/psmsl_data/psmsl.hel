                  THE PERMANENT SERVICE FOR MEAN SEA LEVEL:
                              FURTHER INFORMATION


Since 1933, the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) has been
responsible for the collection, publication, analysis and
interpretation of sea level data from the global network of tide
gauges.  It is based at the National Oceanography Centre, Liverpool,
United Kingdom and is a regular member of the International Council
for Science - World Data System (ICSU-WDS).  It is supported by the
U.K.  Natural Environment Research Council.  The PSMSL reports to the
International Association for the Physical Sciences of the Oceans
(IAPSO) Commission on Mean Sea Level and Tides (President Prof. Gary
T. Mitchum, USA). It also a service of the the International
Association of Geodesy (IAG) and works with the Global Sea Level
Observing System (GLOSS) and the Global Geodetic Observing System
(GGOS).

	    DESCRIPTION OF PSMSL 'RLR' AND 'METRIC' DATASETS

The database of the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL)
contains monthly and annual mean values of sea level from almost 2000
tide gauge stations around the world. (Note that, in common with most
other climate variables, by 'monthly' we mean CALENDAR monthly means.)

The PSMSL receives monthly and annual mean values of sea level from
almost 200 national authorities, distributed around the world,
responsible for sea level monitoring in each country or region.  Data
from each station are entered directly as received from the authority
into the PSMSL raw data file for that station (usually called the
METRIC file in PSMSL publications).  The monthly and annual means so
entered for any one year are necessarily required to be measured to a
common datum, although, at this stage, datum continuity between years
is not essential.  While the PSMSL makes every attempt to spot
inconsistent or erroneous data, the responsibility for the monthly and
annual means entered into the METRIC files in this way is entirely that
of the supplying authority.  A description of data checks routinely
made by the PSMSL is given below and in Woodworth, Spencer and Alcock
(1990) and IOC (1992).

In order to construct time series of sea level measurements at each
station, the monthly and annual means have to be reduced to a common
datum.  This reduction is performed by the PSMSL making use of the tide
gauge datum history provided by the supplying authority.  To date,
approximately two thirds of the stations in the PSMSL database have had
their data adjusted in this way, forming the 'REVISED LOCAL REFERENCE'
(or 'RLR') dataset.  For scientific purposes, the RLR dataset is
normally superior to the 'METRIC', although the latter, which contains
the total PSMSL data holdings, can also be analysed bearing in mind the
above datum continuity considerations. (See below for further comments
on METRIC and RLR differences).  IN GENERAL, THOUGH, ONE SHOULD ONLY
USE THE RLR DATASET FOR TIME SERIES ANALYSIS.

The RLR datum at each station is defined to be approximately 7000mm
below mean sea level, with this arbitrary choice made many years ago in
order to avoid negative numbers in the resulting RLR monthly and annual
mean values. The detailed relationships at each site between RLR datum,
benchmark heights, tide gauge zero etc. are not normally required by
analysts of the dataset, but is available from the individual station
pages.

The contents of the PSMSL dataset used to be described in 'Data
Holdings of the PSMSL' printed reports, of which the last was Spencer
and Woodworth (1993).  Regular updates are now made via the web.
Further information about the PSMSL, and about the spatial and temporal
distribution of the PSMSL data set, can be found in Holgate et al.
(2013) and earlier journal papers referenced therein.

The detailed current contents of the PSMSL databank are described via
files accessed from the PSMSL web page:

http://www.psmsl.org/

In particular, this PSMSL home page points to

http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/

which describes how to access the MSL data sets. The primary identifier
in the PSMSL database is the station ID.  This is a unique integer that
is assigned to each tide gauge site and will not change going forward.
All files (both data files and pages on the website) will use this unique
identifier to refer to a station.

Prior to 2010, stations were referred to by a three digit coastline code
(previously called country code) and a three digit station code.  These
have be retained for continuity.  As an example of coastline codes,
Iceland is defined as '010', followed by Jan Mayen ('012') and the
Faeroe Islands ('015'), and then progressing around the world coastline
in essentially an eastward direction until Greenland ('980'). Antarctica
('999', a change from the previous value of 'A  ') finishes off the
list.  As the list progresses through the various oceans and seas it
also includes the nearby island gauges.  Separate coastline codes are
used for countries abutting more than one ocean or sea, e.g. France
(Atlantic) and France (Mediterranean).  While previously called a
"country" code, the value had no political significance, but was used in
a geographical subdivision sense only.  However, while a change in
country name would not impact this scheme, it is necessary to introduce
a new coastline code when a country splits.  Thus, this scheme is no
longer used as the primary identifier of a tide gauge site.

We note that our use of "country" above with regard to a particular tide
gauge site does not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever
concerning the legal status of any country or territory, or of its
authorities, or concerning the delimitation of the frontiers of any
country or territory.

Station pages provide most of the station information. (NOTE: replace
the #STATION ID# below with the appropriate number)

http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/stations/#STATION ID#.php

Each station page shows the station ID, location (latitude and
longitude), GLOSS ID (if applicable), coastline code, station code,
country, and frequency code.  In addition, there is a time span and
completeness of the data.  The "date of last update" is the last time
the record was altered in the database.  If a quality flag exists for
the station, a warning will be displayed advising further inspection of
the station documentation. Frequency codes are defined as follows:

Code           Meaning  

Integer n      n measurements/day  
C              Integration from continuous recording  
HL             Mean of high and low waters (i.e. Mean Tide Level)  

Below this station information is a data section.  Plots of the monthly
and annual data are shown if the station is RLR. Links to the data for
this station are in this section.  A documentation section follows the
data section.  This will include a link to the RLR information, if
appropriate, as well as any comments relevant to the station.  

Finally, the authority information is listed, along with any authority
comments that are relevant.  For some of the longer sea level records,
different authorities may have been responsible for the operation of the
tide gauge and the analysis of its data at different times.  The
authority-codes shown here refer to the authority most recently
responsible. A change of authority is indicated within the documentation
embedded with the PSMSL data files, while a full history of the
operation of a particular tide gauge can be obtained from the PSMSL.

We also have generated a data catalogue (catalogue.dat) which details the
entire holdings of the PSMSL.  The stations are ordered first alphabetically
by country, territory or area name (starting with Ã…LAND ISLANDS), then grouped
by coastline code, and finally listed within each group by station code.  Each
station entry starts with station code, station name, latitude, longitude,
authority code/frequency code (as described above), and GLOSS ID (if
applicable). Each entry is then finished with separate lines for the Station
ID, metric data time span, metric completeness, RLR time span, and RLR
completeness.  A second file (nucat.dat) condenses the information for each
station down to one line.  Each station line of this file contains the PSMSL
ID, station code, station name, latitude, longitude, authority code, frequency
code, GLOSS ID, metric data time span, metric completeness, RLR time span, and
RLR completeness. These files can be found at

             FURTHER COMMENTS ON SEVERAL RLR RECORDS FROM A STATION

You will see that several stations contain more than one PSMSL RLR record.
RLR records are kept separate if, for example, they are from completely
separate sets of measurements from different locations in the area
of the station. Another reason is if the benchmark datums of the separate
records epochs cannot be geodetically connected. A further reason is if one
section of data is MSL and a further set is MTL.

However, there are a small number of pairs of RLR records which can be
combined into composites, with some reservations about care in using
them because of, perhaps, long periods of time between them. These include:

Aberdeen I (ID: 361) which is MSL and Aberdeen II (ID: 21) which is MTL
but which are geodetically connected to a common benchmark

Venezia (San Stefano) (ID: 39) and Venezia (Punta della Salute) (ID: 168) 
in Venice, which are from separate sites but which are geodetically connected
to a common benchmark.

North Point (ID: 333) and Quarry Bay (ID: 1674) in Hong Kong, which are
from quite separate sites in areas of reclaimed land but which are
geodetically connected to a common, if somewhat distant, benchmark.

Auckland-Waitemata Harbour (ID: 217) and Auckland II (ID: 150) from Auckland,
New Zealand, the former being provided by the RNZN Hydrographic Office,
although gappy, and the latter being provided by the work of Prof. John Hannah
and more complete but not up-to-date.

Port Stanley (ID: 1082) and Port Stanley II (ID: 1796) in the Falkland
Islands (Malvinas) which are geodetically connected to a common
benchmark but are separated by a large period of time

In each of these cases, the brief documentation should be consulted
with regard to the construction of composite time series.

                         MIXED MTL AND MSL DATA

Above were given a few examples of MTL and MSL records that had been
kept separate.  Unfortunately, however, there are some examples where
the two data types have been combined into a single record.  In some
of the more extreme cases, the annual average difference between these
two mean levels can be over 10 cm, which could introduce an artifact
into estimates of the long-term trends.

In an attempt to make these combined records more transparent, and to
cause the minimum disruption to the current set of records, we have
introduced a flag 010 (described further in DATA FORMATS below)
indicating MTL values in a MSL record. In addition, we have applied an
estimate of the annual average difference (MTL-MSL) to the RLR time
series, so that these values should be more directly comparable with the
rest of the MSL records. Note that the metric files have the MTL
values flagged but do not have the correction applied.   

Caveats: For the differences between MTL and MSL, we are generally
using results provided by Philip Woodworth in conjunction with his
manuscript on the subject.  The difference does have a seasonal
component, and we are only using an annual average for the correction.
Thus, the seasonal portion of the MTL and MSL values still cannot be
compared, even after we have applied the correction. Typically, we are
using recent data to estimate a correction applied to data in the
1800s or early 1900s.  Thus, we are explicitly assuming that the
difference has not changed in time.  In some cases, there is not any
high-frequency data needed to conduct an analysis.  In others, we have
reason to believe that the correction is highly uncertain (at greater
than the 1 cm level).  Both cases will be addressed through flagging
described below.

The zip files contain a file (mtl_msl_corrections.csv) that lists
the Station ID, the start and end of the MTL data within the time
series,  and the value of the MTL-MSL estimate applied to the data
[applied as MTL value â€“ (MTL â€“ MSL estimate) = MSL estimate].  This
should enable one to easily remove the correction [MSL estimate + (MTL
â€“ MSL estimate) = original MTL value] and substitute your own if
desired.  The flag also would enable one to ignore the MSL estimates
values completely in the analysis if desired.  If we have no estimate
of the MTL-MSL difference, the value will be set to -99999 in this
file, but will effectively be 0 in the data file, i.e. the MTL value
will remain unchanged in the distributed data file, but will have the
flags 011.  In the case of the flags 011 and a value not equal to
-99999, this indicates that we have reason to believe that this value
may be uncertain to greater than 1 cm.   A note will be placed in the
documentation file as to why the â€˜flagged for attentionâ€™ was set.  We
would recommend that values with the flags 011 not be used in analysis
of long-term trends.

               FURTHER COMMENTS ON THE USE OF 'METRIC' DATA

Without the provision of full benchmark datum history information, records
will remain as 'Metric only' in the databank and not as 'RLR'. It is a
good general rule, therefore, that 'Metric' records should NEVER be used for
time series analysis or for the computation of secular trends; without
datum continuity their only use is in studies of the seasonal cycle of mean
sea level. If there is any doubt about the datums for a particular record,
the PSMSL would be pleased to supply clarification. 

There are, however, some 'Metric only' records which almost certainly can be
used for time series work, even though the PSMSL does not have full benchmark
datum histories.  They include, in particular, a number of German 'Metric'
records which are measured with respect to Normal Null (NN). Any such
information is included in the station comments in the relevant documentation
sections of the data sets supplied by the PSMSL.  Even though these records are
expressed relative to the national levelling systems, they are, in effect,
relative to a local level as required for RLR purposes i.e. the records do not
(as far as we know) contain datum shifts contributed by re-levelling
adjustments. In general, however, measurements relative to national levelling
systems may well reflect such adjustments, which explains why the PSMSL has
traditionally steered clear of classifying such data as RLR.  We have relaxed
this classification slightly for a few of the German stations.  In the late
1990s and early 2000s, the PSMSL received data from these stations that could
be related to a tide gauge benchmark as well as NN.  Using these relationships,
we have reclassified these entire time series as RLR.

In the past, the PSMSL also included the the Netherlands data in the above
category of Metric records acceptable for time series work.  These records are
expressed relative to the national level system Normaal Amsterdamsch Peil
(NAP).  However, a recent re-levelling of NAP in 2005 introduced a small datum
shift for the tide gauge time series. In order to maintain utility of these
long records, we have reclassified most of the Netherlands records as RLR and
introduced different RLR factors for the periods before and after 2005.  While
these records do not meet the strict definition of RLR and may still include
prior re-levelling adjustments, we believe this represents the best path
forward.

                        ELLIPSOIDAL LINKS FOR RLR DATA

PSMSL are able to publish estimates of the height of our RLR data above a
reference ellipsoid (GRS80) in some cases, where a permanent GNSS station has 
been installed near the tide gauge, and the two instruments have been connected
through levelling. In these cases the link is listed on the station's RLR
diagram page. Estimates are provided by SystÃ¨me d'Observation du Niveau des 
Eaux Littorales (SONEL). Full details are included at the page

http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/ellipsoid.php

The zip files contain a file (ellipsoidal_links.csv) that lists the stations
for which such a link has been made.


                               DATA FORMATS

The page

http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/notes.php

gives detailed information on the formats of the data sets.  Prior to
2010, the entirety of the PSMSL database had be distributed in condensed
formats (e.g., psmsl.dat and rlrann.dat).  However, with the update of
the backend database, maintaining these formats was no longer possible.

Data is now distributed as individual time series for each station.  The
entire dataset (including documentation) is distributed in zipped files,
described further below.  Separate time series files exist for the RLR
monthly mean data, the RLR annual mean data, and the Metric monthly mean
data (same strong warnings as above regarding the Metric data apply).  

Separate directories for each data type exist:

http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/rlr.monthly.data/
http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/rlr.annual.data/
http://www.psmsl.org/data/obtaining/met.monthly.data/

Each directory contains a file list (filelist.txt) consisting of the
station ID, latitude, longitude, station name, coastline code, station
code, and quality flag.  These files can be used translate between the
new station ID and the old coastline/station codes.  The quality flag
has a value of "N" or "Y", where "Y" indicates that the documentation
files should be consulted.  More information on the quality flag is
given three paragraphs below.

Details of the data formats can be found on the notes.php page listed
above.  It should be noted that the time series file have internal flags
for each data point.  For example, the monthly files have an entry that
indicates how many days were missing in the average.  The annual file
has an entry ("N" or "Y") that indicates, in the case of "Y", that
either one month was missing or that at least 30 days were missing.
(The annual average is dropped if more than one monthly value is missing.
A monthly value is calculated as long as 15 or less days are missing in
a month.) In both cases, a quality flag is present.  A value of "001"
indicates that the flag is present (see below).  

Each of the above directories will also contain the appropriate zip file:
rlr.annual.zip, rlr.monthly.zip, or met.monthly.zip.  These zip files
will contain filelist.txt, described above, and two directories
(docu and data).  Two documentation files may exist for each station:
station documentation (named docu/#STATION ID#.txt) and authority
documentation (named docu/#STATION ID#_auth.txt).  A data file for each entry
in the filelist.txt will exist and be named data/#STATION ID#.rlrdata or
data/#STATION ID#.metdata, as appropriate.  Matlab code for reading in
all of the data from one of these set is distributed with the zip file.

Each set of PSMSL data files contain within them documentation warning
flags which are used to point to either a suspect station record, a
suspect station-year, or a suspect station-month. These flags are set
on the basis of either the data checks described below or after
further detailed scientific analysis.  For monthly and annual data
files, these flags will take the form of octal number, similar to UNIX
permissions.  The 'flag for attention' described above is "001". In
addition, we have introduced the flag "010", which indicates that the
value was a MTL value (perhaps corrected to MSL in the RLR file) in a
MSL record.  Both flags being true would be indicated by "011".
Please see the above notes.php page for more information.


                              PSMSL DATA CHECKS

The following describes the checks made by the PSMSL on data received from
national authorities. Details can also be found in PSMSL publications (e.g.
Woodworth, Spencer and Alcock, Int. Hyd. Rev., 67(1), 131-146, 1990).
 
In general, in years past the PSMSL has not received copies of original tide
gauge hourly height measurements or continuous charts but has accepted monthly
and annual mean sea level (MSL) values from national authorities on the
understanding that these quantities have been computed accurately. Inevitably,
this has always not been the case.
 
The PSMSL has devised a range of tests on the supplied MSL information which
guards against gross errors in the dataset such as transcription errors or
large unrecorded datum changes. Some of these tests are 'common sense', others
are 'statistical':
 
(1) A check is made that the average of the quoted monthly mean values is
consistent with the quoted annual mean.

(2) 'Common sense' consistency checks are made on the data including checking
that the datum information is consistent with previous knowledge. This includes
reference to back correspondence and simple time series plotting.
  
(3) A search for outliers is made on data for each calendar month of the year
separately, and for the annual means, for all possible time-spans containing
at least 20 years of data. A linear fit is made to the time series and any
individual monthly mean value more than 4.5 standard deviations from the
fitted line is flagged.
 
(4) A search is made for incorrect datum information by performing a set of
linear regressions of RLR annual mean values against the supplied datum
correction factors ('RLR factors' in PSMSL terminology) in all possible
20-year time-spans. A correctly adjusted RLR time series should be uncorrelated
with the RLR factors.
 
(5) A search for jumps in the RLR time series is made for each calendar month
of the year separately and for the annual means. The difference between a mean
value and the corresponding value for the next year of data is histogrammed
and any outlier more than 4.5 standard deviations from the mean-difference is
flagged.  

(6) A test is made for 'upside down' data. In several countries the main
research interest is the study of vertical land movements, rather than sea
level changes, with the result that MSL data are often quoted as the distance
below a benchmark height rather than above it. The most sensitive test to guard
against such an error is an inspection of the seasonal cycle which, for 'upside
down' data, would appear opposite to that observed in neighbouring records and
opposite to oceanographic and meteorological expectations.
 
(7) A set of 'buddy checking' is made in which the RLR data from one station
is subtracted from that of a neighbouring station (or 'buddy') which is less
than 400km away. Over this short distance most of the MSL variability due to
oceanographic and meteorological forcings in the two records should be similar
and will cancel out giving a difference time series primarily composed of
relative vertical land movements, instrumental and datum errors and any small
spatially varying ocean and weather influences. The previous tests are then
applied to the difference time series and any discrepancies are flagged. 
 
These tests have been applied to the entire dataset and inconsistencies have
been referred back to the national authorities, although the reasons for some
apparent oddities are no doubt lost in history.
  

      RECOMMENDATIONS TO AUTHORITIES CONTRIBUTING DATA TO THE PSMSL    

a) General  

The Permanent Service appreciates the contributions from all organisations
supplying mean sea level data and does not seek to impose unnecessary
conditions upon contributors.  Nevertheless a minimum of quality control must
be exercised if the data bank is to be an authoritative reference.  To this end
the PSMSL requests the following information together with each set of monthly
and annual mean sea level values supplied:  

i) the units used (metres, rarely feet),  

ii) a statement of the datum to which the values refer,  

iii) a statement of the measured depth of that datum below the primary tide
gauge bench mark (TGBM),  

iv) an indication of incomplete or deduced data (see paragraph b),  

v) the number of observations per day used to calculate the monthly means,  

vi) any information of changes in datums, bench marks or relevant procedures
since the previous batch of data,  

vii) any information on the availability of more frequent readings (e.g.
hourly heights).  

Although data will be accepted in any format, mean heights should preferably
be in the metric system to the nearest millimetre, and the datum to which
the means refer should preferably be the tide gauge zero. Data will be
gratefully received in any form (e.g. as paper tabulations in letters or 
via email).  

b) Treatment of incomplete records  

One of the most important things for users of the mean sea level data bank
to know is the accuracy of the published figures.  Details of the treatment
of gaps in the tidal record are of particular interest. Therefore, the PSMSL
makes the following recommendations:  

i) small gaps in observed tidal records should be interpolated, if possible
before computing monthly and annual means,  

ii) the interpolation should be performed at an early stage in the processing.
One principle to adopt is that of a comparison with the complete records from
a nearby station.  However we would stress that predicted values are not
suitable for interpolation because of meteorological effects,  

iii) in cases where interpolation is impossible the monthly mean should be
compiled from the incomplete data.  Where more than 15 days are missing from
a month a mean value should not be computed,  

iv) when sending mean values to the PSMSL, authorities are requested to
indicate if interpolation has been effected or the exact number of missing
days of data.  These details should be sent as suffixes after each monthly
mean and shown in brackets:

e.g. 2487(9) would mean 9 daily mean values were missing and not interpolated
when computing the mean of 2487mm; 913(XX) would mean missing data were
interpolated to provide the average of 913mm,  

v) if there are 11 or 12 monthly mean values available then an annual mean
should be calculated.  If the annual mean is computed by averaging the
monthly means, the monthly means must first be weighted.  The weight for
each month should be the number of days for which readings were available.  

c) Computation of monthly and annual mean values  

The attention of data contributors is drawn to three IOC publications 
entitled 'Manual on Sea Level Measurement and Interpretation' which can be
downloaded from

http://www.psmsl.org/train_and_info/training/manuals/

The third one is especially worth considering with regard to monthly
mean computation. The PSMSL will be pleased to assist with advice on methods
of data processing and the determination of mean values.

d) Preservation of original data

Contributors are urged to preserve the original sea level data in
permanent form.  The information contained in such basic time series is
of great value in many scientific studies, is irreplaceable, and should
not be lost to posterity. Where original data are available in computer
compatible form, the PSMSL would be grateful to receive copies (and in
the case of GLOSS stations, it is a requirement that any such data are
provided to GLOSS Archiving Centres, of which the PSMSL is one, see
below). Such global databanking of higher frequency information will
evolve considerably over the next few years as a result of GLOSS and
related activities.


                     LINKAGE TO THE GLOSS PROGRAMME

The Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) is a programme
coordinated by the Joint Technical Commission for Oceanography and
Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic
Commission (IOC) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). It
aims for the establishment of global and regional sea level networks
for oceanographic, climate change and coastal research purposes. The
main component of GLOSS is the 'Global Core Network' (GCN) for long
term climate change and oceanographic sea level monitoring. For full
details, see the page

http://www.gloss-sealevel.org/

The development of GLOSS can be traced through the various
Implementation Plans for the programme and through related documents
(IOC, 1990; Woodworth and Player, 2003).  The most recent
Implementation Plan (IOC, 2012) can be downloaded from the
above page.

The PSMSL took a major lead in the planning of GLOSS which in the long
term will result in a significant improvement in the quantity and
quality of data delivered to the PSMSL. Further information on the
development of GLOSS from a PSMSL perspective can be found via the above
web pages and Woodworth (1998), Woodworth and Player (2003), and Holgate
et al. (2013).

The PSMSL has played a particularly important part in GLOSS's provision
of training courses and training materials with courses held at the
PSMSL, and with PSMSL-related scientists having taken part in courses
overseas.

Recent years have seen major efforts to collect higher frequency
(typically hourly) sea level data as well as MSL information. In
collaboration with the British Oceanographic Data Centre and the
University of Hawaii Sea Level Center, the PSMSL also functions as a
'GLOSS Archiving Centre' for higher frequency sea level data. See the
