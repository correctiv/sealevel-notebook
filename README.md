# sealevel-notebook

Several notebooks for analysing tide measurement data. Sources are:
- University of Hawaii, http://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/data/
- British Oceanographic Data Centre, https://www.bodc.ac.uk/
- Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services, https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/
- Permanent Service of Mean Sea Level (PSMSL), http://www.psmsl.org/
- Sea Level Trends from PSMSL, http://www.psmsl.org/products/trends/data/


The most exhaustive data set is in the PSMSL notebook (SeaLevel_psmsl.ipynb). It includes 1505 tide gauges worldwide.

The notebook SeaLevel_tideData.ipynb provides everything to create the data sets for the sea level visualization. The notebook SeaLevel_contextData.ipynb creates the data sets needed for the data explorer.

The context data also contains data from the Worldbank (CO2) andf from the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center of the Columbia University for the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ)
